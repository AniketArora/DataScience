# Placeholder for Streamlit app tests
# Testing Streamlit apps directly with pytest can be complex and might require
# tools like Playwright or Selenium for UI interaction, or specific Streamlit
# testing utilities if available and suitable.

# For now, we can add very basic non-UI logic tests if any were in main.py,
# or keep this as a placeholder.
