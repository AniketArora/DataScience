# Python Data Analysis Project

This project aims to provide a flexible and user-friendly tool for analyzing datasets from various sources. It features a Streamlit-based frontend for interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Features

*   **Connect to Multiple Databases:** Easily connect to databases like PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch.
*   **Interactive Frontend:** Utilize Streamlit for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
*   **Data Loading and Display:** Load data from connected sources and display it in a tabular format.
*   **Basic Data Analysis:** Perform initial data analysis tasks such as:
    *   Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
    *   Data filtering
*   **Visualization:** Generate simple plots like histograms and scatter plots.
*   **Extensible:** Designed to be easily extendable with new data sources, analysis modules, and visualizations.

## Planned Structure

*   `src/main.py`: Main Streamlit application.
*   `src/database.py`: Modules for database connections.
*   `src/utils.py`: Utility functions.
*   `data/`: Directory for sample datasets.
*   `tests/`: Directory for unit tests.
*   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
*   `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.
